# PhobGCC

PhobGCC is an open-source Gamecube controller motherboard aiming to make an accessible and consistent controller. The key feature is the use of hall effect sensors instead of potentiometers, which eliminates a wear item. Additonally, it features notch calibration, digital snapback filtering, button remapping, and various trigger configurations.
